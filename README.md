# HandPosing
This project uses Oculus Quest hand-tracking to control Oculus default rigged hands.

You need to download the **Oculus Utilities** from the Asset Store, as this requires OVRSkeleton.

Open the **PoseTest** scene, the most important bit are the bindings in **RightHandAnchor** and **LeftHandAnchor** that demonstrates what joints from the tracked hand correspond to the ones in the model (pay special attention to the thumb and the pinky) and their offsets.
