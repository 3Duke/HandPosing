Hand tracked controlled Hand models

You need to download the **Oculus Utilities** from the Asset Store, as this requires OVRSkeleton.
The most important bit are the bindings in **RightHandAnchor** and **LeftHandAnchor** that demonstrates what joints from the tracked hand correspond to the ones in the model (pay special attention to the thumb and the pinky).
