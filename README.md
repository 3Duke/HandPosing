# HandPosing
This project uses Oculus Quest hand-tracking to control Oculus default rigged hands and use it to generate grab poses. Clone this repo or pick the **.unitypackage** in the releases section.  
- You need to download the **Oculus Integration** from the Asset Store, as this requires OVRSkeleton. I have tested it with Unity 2019.3 and Oculus Integration 17.0 and 18.0.
- You need to use **Quest + Oculus Link** in the editor to generate poses (but the generated poses will work in a build with either hands or controllers).
- Check the **demo scene** with instructions.

And please leave a **star** if this helped you, it truly helps keep the motivation going!

You can download the latest stable package in the [releases section](https://github.com/MephestoKhaan/HandPosing/releases/).

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/MephestoKhaan/HandPosing/wiki) for the documentation.

This is a work in progress, and things are subject to change. I hope it serves others either as a useful tool or at least as a starting point for their grabbing-interaction implementations. At this moment I won't be accepting **Pull Requests** but reach me in the issues if something is not right or have any feature in mind that you think is missing.
